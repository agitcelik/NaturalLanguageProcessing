# NaturalLanguageProcessing
Data preprocessing with Natural Language Processing methods such as tokenizer, stopwords, PorterStemmer, bag of words etc. to clean and make data clear. Then, Some Machine Learning Algorithm were applied. 


1. In order to feed the applied machine learning algorithms with our textual data as input, it is needed to change the form of representation of the text data. You are expected to use the Bag-of-Words model to encode text data to a list of vectors of features.
2. After having the text data with the proper form of representation, you are expected to apply Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM and kNN algorithms.
3. For each applied algorithm, you are expected to list Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score points.
4. As the last step, you are required to create a function which takes two parameters that are randomly selected reviews from your dataset and compares the similarity of the sentences semantically. You are expected to use WordNet to compute the similarity of the sentences, since it is well-known and extensively used in the community.
